# Project_3_All_In_One

## Project Description
All In One is a wholesale food supplier that consists of Microsoft Dynamics 365 model-driven applications driven around the concept of supporting customer relationship management for B2B sales. The applications will allow employees to carry out all tasks related to marketing, sales, field services and customer support. Using the pre-built components supplied by Dynamics 365 as a base, the applications will contain customized forms, templates, and tables that are molded to fit the needs of our wholesale food business. In the marketing app, potential customers will be segmented into groups based on the type of restaurant they are operating. This enables the creation of tailored marketing ads and campaigns. The All in One Wholesale Food Market consists of a sales application that will allow users to qualify interested leads to opportunities. Once an opportunity is created, a user is guided through the Sales Lifecycle to offer customers a wide variety of imported and locally sourced perishable and nonperishable food products. The sales app will track products that frequently draw customer interest, organizing potential leads while noting the shipment time and volume needs of the customer with the goal of closing each sale. When our customers have problems arise with shipping or ordering, they are helped by one of our customer service representatives within the All In One Customer Service environment and service management. The customer service application will efficiently address the needs brought to the company by customers via phone, e-mail, or the Internet. Customers can submit problems they have experienced with their products or with shipping. Finally, the field service application will utilize the inventory management and product order functionalities to ensure optimal warehouse operation, maintaining minimum stock and avoiding overstocking.
